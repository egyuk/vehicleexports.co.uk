# Sailing schedule pipeline

Refreshes `src/data/sailing-schedules.json`, which drives `/uk-car-sailing-schedule`.

```bash
npm run schedules:update            # fetch, merge, validate, write
npm run schedules:update -- --dry-run   # report what would change, write nothing
npm run schedules:update -- --fresh     # ignore the download cache
```

No dependencies — plain Node, no npm packages and no headless browser. Downloads
are cached for an hour in `scripts/schedules/.cache/` (gitignored).

## Why this is more than "read the PDF"

Five sources, and between them four different PDF generators. A generic text
dump fails on all of them, each for a different reason. `lib/pdf.mjs` handles the
union; the source modules only interpret rows.

| Source | Format | The trap |
|---|---|---|
| NMT | jsPDF, **uncompressed** streams | Text is hex CIDs; needs per-font ToUnicode or you get nothing but the word "Terminates" |
| "K" Line | Excel → PDF, Flate | Vessels are columns; ports are arrival/sailing row pairs around a label |
| Grimaldi | Excel → PDF, Flate | Two blocks in one sheet; only the first calls Tilbury |
| Geest | Print to PDF, Flate | TJ arrays of hex CIDs, flipped y axis, **two sub-columns per port** |
| Autoshippers | HTML | Tables use `rowspan`; the grid must be expanded before reading |
| Wallenius Wilhelmsen | JSON API | Site search is broken server-side; the voyage endpoints work (~320 GETs). Port names embed US state codes ("MANZANILLO, PA" is Panama) - use the API country field |
| Sallaum Lines | HTML tables | Empty cells are **unclosed** `<td>`, so position-based parsing left-packs rows and misattributes dates. Bind via each cell's `headers` attribute instead |
| NYK RoRo | WordPress ajax | vessel -> vesselNums -> vesselSearch -> showDetails chain; rotation HTML has one year header, so the year is carried forward across month wraps |
| Höegh Autoliners | JSON API | `/api/vessel`'s params are swapped: `departureDate` is the *until* bound, `arrivalDate` the *from*. Pair across voyage numbers - they are administrative, and Höegh's own search sells Southampton (voy 189) -> Kingston (voy 190). Also emits through-routes over the two Caribbean feeder hubs (Kingston and Pointe-à-Pitre) onto the Eastern Caribbean feeder (Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, the islands), flagged in `notes` - restricted to Caribbean/South America ports with no direct UK call, deduped across hubs by fastest onward arrival |
| MOL ACE | ASP.NET ajax | Three steps: LocationLOV resolves UK port codes (skip the "DO NOT USE" tombstones), a dated search lists load calls, then a per-voyage search returns the rotation with (L)/(D) flags - the carrier states load vs discharge, so it need not be inferred |
| ACL | MyACL portal POST | GET the search page for the anti-forgery token, cookie and an embedded DevExpress port directory, then POST. Dates in the raw HTML are US M/D/YYYY - the dd/mm seen in a browser is client-side formatting |
| Hyundai Glovis | PDF (Stena Glovis) | Weekly per-lane PDFs whose URL carries the ISO week; scrape the page for the current set. Vessel-column grid, sparse rows, so bind dates by x position. Uses xref-stream/ObjStm PDFs (see below) |
| UECC | PDF | A day-by-day calendar, not a port table: read each vessel's rotation *down* its column. "II"/"ll" mean still at sea, and dd-mm dates need the year rolled from the issue date |
| Stena Line | AEM JSON, per day | The freight extranet's timetable search 404s publicly; the same ro-pax departures are on the passenger route pages as `_jcr_content.timetable.<CODE>.<date>.json`. Codes are unguessable (HHDB, FIRO) - watch the page's own requests |
| EUKOR | jQuery-era `.do` POST | One POST takes every UK port against every foreign port at once (~330 codes from the page's own `var code/var des` script pairs). Rows with an empty vessel cell continue the sailing above; one port (`Port Klang (Pelabuhan Klang),`) has no country at all |
| MSC | JSON API behind Akamai | POST-only, one port pair per request, so the crawl is load ports x destinations (396). Omit `x-requested-with: XMLHttpRequest` and it answers **200 with a body of `""`** rather than an error. No country in the route payload - join `PortOfDischargeId` against the port dictionary. The route-level `VesselName` is the UK **feeder**, not the ship that arrives: take the last leg with a named vessel, and keep the feeder in `notes`. `optional = true` because Akamai fingerprints the client and has blocked this one before |

Two lessons worth keeping:

1. **Never read a sparse table by reading order.** Geest rows omit ports
   entirely, so token order lies. Dates are matched by reconstructed x position.
2. **Use the font's real `/W` glyph widths.** Estimated widths accumulate error
   across a wide row and land dates under the wrong island. `/W` is usually an
   *indirect* object (`/W 9 0 R`), which is easy to miss.

A fourth, from adding Glovis: **modern PDFs hide their dictionaries.** Files
written with xref streams pack fonts and page resources into compressed
`/ObjStm` object streams, so a plain `obj ... endobj` scan finds no fonts and
every page decodes as gibberish. `loadPdf` now inflates those. Two traps came
with it: a simple (non-Type0) subset font writes **one-byte** codes, not 2-byte
CIDs, and its literal strings are glyph codes that must still go through
ToUnicode - so `` inside a string can mean the letter "D", and resolving
escapes to whitespace before mapping silently eats characters.

A third, learned the hard way: apply a page `cm` transform **only** if it is at
the very start of the content stream. Content streams also place images with
`cm`, and matching one of those scales every coordinate by a few hundred.

## Service type: RoRo vs container

Every row carries `service`: `roro`, `container`, `conro` or `unknown`. Each
source module declares its own with `export const service = ...`, and
`update.mjs` **throws if a source omits it** rather than defaulting, because
quoting a container transit as a RoRo one sells the customer the wrong service.

`conro` means the vessel carries both and the customer can choose. ACL's
Liverpool to North America service is the one in the data: their G4 ships take
containers and rolling cargo on the same sailing, so a car can go either way on
the same departure. It is badged on the site as a benefit rather than a caveat,
and it is the only service in the data where one departure offers both modes.

`unknown` is not a soft default, it is an honest answer. The aggregator sources
republish other operators' sailings, and after the merge any row still without a
named carrier is downgraded from `roro` to `unknown` — if nobody could attribute
it to an operator, it cannot be vouched for as RoRo either. That downgrade runs
**after** the merge loop, because the loop back-fills a blank carrier from a
later duplicate, so attribution is not final until every source is in.

This came from a real fault: Jordan's only two sailings were unattributed and
turned out to be container services, while the page presented their transit as
if it were RoRo. The site now badges anything that is not plain RoRo, on both
the country pages and the full schedule.

Two of the twenty sources are pure container lines: MSC (`optional`, behind
Akamai) and Ellerman City Liners (a UK shortsea feeder). Every other source is a
RoRo or ro-pax operator, and ACL is the one ConRo. The CMA CGM note in
SITE-BACKLOG.md records why CMA CGM itself is not viable. The obvious next
container source is ONE (Ocean Network Express): `ecomm.one-line.com/api/v1/schedule/port`
and `.../schedule/vessel/port-list` answered plain anonymous fetch in September
2026 with dated UK departures and full rotations, the same port-then-voyage shape
as the MSC, NYK and MOL modules. Its point-to-point search is Turnstile-gated
and must not be used.

## Data quality rules

- Sources merge in confidence order (NMT → K Line → Grimaldi → Geest →
  Autoshippers); the first to describe a sailing wins. A carrier's own arrival
  date always beats a forwarder's derived one — they disagreed by five days on
  a real Baltimore sailing.
- Carrier is named only where the vessel name makes it unambiguous. A wrong
  carrier is worse than a blank cell.
- Autoshippers ETAs are departure + published transit, and say so in `notes`.
- Only sailings departing a **UK** port are kept. Continental departures exist
  in most of these schedules and are deliberately excluded.

## Validation gates

The run **refuses to write** if any fire. Each exists because it caught a real
fault:

- **Per-source row floor** — the dangerous failure is not a crash, it is a
  source silently returning zero after a layout change and deleting a lane.
- **Weekly cadence (Geest)** — a weekly service must step in whole weeks per
  port. This is what proves the column mapping; a single misassigned column
  shatters it.
- **Arrival after departure**, **transit ≤ 120 days**, required fields present.
- **Stale rows dropped with a warning** — NMT publish the occasional year-old
  rotation with a nonsense leg (one had 334 days).

## When a carrier changes their layout

The source module throws with a message naming what it could not find
(`"K Line: Southampton block not found - layout changed"`). Re-run with
`--dry-run`, then inspect the rows:

```bash
node -e "import('./scripts/schedules/lib/pdf.mjs').then(async({pdfRows})=>{const{fetchCached}=await import('./scripts/schedules/lib/util.mjs');const rows=pdfRows(await fetchCached('<pdf-url>'));rows.slice(0,25).forEach(r=>console.log(r.cells.map(c=>c.text+'@'+Math.round(c.x)).join(' | ')));})"
```

Known dead ends, so nobody re-treads them: NMT's HTML schedule renders
client-side and returns nothing; its per-lane API endpoints are not public (only
`/api/schedules/services`, the lane directory). Grimaldi's Europe–South America
PDF has its ToUnicode maps inside compressed object streams and cannot currently
be decoded. Höegh's port-pair *search* posts a server action that returns nothing
outside a real browser session - but that search was never the data path: the
page's client bundle loads a vessel directory from m.hoegh.com and then GETs
`/api/vessel` per vessel, both plain JSON (see `sources/hoegh.mjs`).

## Gaps

- Middle East coverage is thin: NMT's lanes plus whatever Höegh voyage
  happens to load in the UK before Oman/India (most run from Antwerp only).
- Grimaldi publish only West Africa for UK departures; their South America
  schedule is undecodable (above).
- Geest Q2/Q4 archives parse fine but contribute nothing once past.
